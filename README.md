This is gonna be a printer spammer basically.

System agnostic, works out current interface, network submask, list of IPs, scans for printers, f[ri]cks 'em up

### TODO:
- [x] Modularise

- [ ] Get someone with printers to actually test this

- [ ] Add more protocols and payloads

- [ ] Add user input for page amount, payload type, etc.

- [ ] Change to partial TCP connect to reduce noise and papertrail

- [ ] Add IP & MAC spoofing and other detection avoidance
